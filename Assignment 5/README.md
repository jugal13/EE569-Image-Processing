# Assignment 5

## [Question 1 - CNN Training on LeNet-5](<codes/Question 1.ipynb>)

- Build a LeNet Classifier
- Train multiple model on MNSIT, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10
- Obtain the required values and plot the graphs of epoch over accuracy along with standard deviations
- Plot confusion matrix for FashionMNIST
- Plot One vs ROC for CIFAR10
- Computer the AUROC
- Implement noise generation
- Train model with 0,20,40,60,80% noise for FashionMNIST

## [Question 2 - Vision Transformer](<codes/Question 2 - ViT/>)

- Run provided transformer training on MNIST for 100 epochs to compare performance against CNN
